## 1. What is the Database and Why Does It Exist?
A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically based on the use of a **(DBMS) Database Management System)**.

Databases are designed to manage large amounts of information efficiently, enabling easy retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion of data.

**Why does it exist?**  
- To store data in an organized way.  
- To enable fast and efficient data retrieval.  
- To support data integrity and security.  
- To allow multiple users to access data simultaneously.

## 2. What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to:
- Retrieve data from a database.
- Create and modify database structures (tables, views, etc.).
- Insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
- Control access to data through permissions.

## 3. What Are the 5 Most Famous Databases in the World Now and Why?
1. **Oracle Database** - Highly robust with advanced features for large-scale enterprise applications.
2. **MySQL** - Widely used for web applications, open-source, and highly reliable.**MySQL** - Widely used for web applications, open-source, and highly reliable.
3. **Microsoft SQL Server** - Preferred in enterprise environments for strong integration with Microsoft products.
4. **PostgreSQL** - Known for advanced features, strong performance, and extensibility.
5. **MongoDB** - A NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility with unstructured data.

## 4. What is RDBMS?

An **RDBMS (relational database management system)** is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to `create` , 
`update` , `admister` and otherwise interact with relational database.

## 5. RDBMS VS DBMS

`Definition`

**DBMS** :  A software program that not only stores databases but also maintains and manages them and controls access to them. Data is stored as files. 

**RDBMS** : An advanced form of a DBMS. Data is organised in tables to interpret relations and differences. 

`Examples`

**DBMS**  
- Windows registry
- Microsoft Access
- MongoDB
- XML

**RDBMS** 
- SQL
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Oracle

`Characteristics`

***DBMS***

1. **Multithreading:** Error-free simultaneous usage of multiple databases

2. **Security:** Secures the database with limited access to users according to the requirements

3. **Efficiency:** Strong query language

4. **Preservation:** Backup and recovery

5. **Integrity:** Better quality and reliability due to data integrity 

6. **Self-explaining nature:** Self-definition of data

7. **Versatility:** Takes up any datatype

8. **ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) compliant:** Adheres to crucial database properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability

***RDBMS***

1. **Accuracy:** Eliminates erroneous data duplication since data is stored only once

2. **Categorisation:** Data is easily categorised to filter and extract efficiently

3. **SQL efficiency:** SQL facilitates complex queries

4. **Security:** Permissions prevent unauthorised access

5. **Flexibility:** Data is automatically updated throughout the system when a change is made

6. **Automation:** Stored procedures eliminate the need for constant coding

7. **ACID compliant:** Adheres to crucial database properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability

## 6. Naming conventions

A **naming conventions** is a convention (generally agreed scheme) for naming things. Conventions differ in their intents, which may include to:

- Allow useful information to be deduced from the names based on regularities.

- Show relationships, and in most personal naming conventions

- Ensure that each name is unique for same scope
